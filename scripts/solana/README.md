# FARTNODE Solana Scripts

This directory will house operational scripts for managing the Solana toolchain:

- `keypair-init.ts` – create ephemeral keypairs for previews
- `airdrop.ts` – request devnet SOL for preview wallets
- `deploy.ts` – build and deploy the Anchor workspace, updating `app/web/lib/ids.ts`

The files are not implemented yet; the stubs will land in subsequent PRs.
