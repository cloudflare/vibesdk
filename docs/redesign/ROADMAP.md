# Project Close-Out — What's Shipped, What's Pending

**Branch:** `inspiring-roentgen-65e47e`
**Commits this initiative:** 4 (8a3caef, 92e307f, 74c9a48, HEAD)
**Honest status:** Phase 2 complete (design + scaffolds); Phase 3 ~40% (billing fully wired, multi-agent coordinator type-clean but not yet invoked by CodeGeneratorAgent)

## What's In Git (Reality Check)

```
# schema: area|files|compile-confidence|demo-confidence
infra-decision|INFRASTRUCTURE.md COST-OPTIMIZATION.md|n/a (docs)|HIGH — GCP 43× more expensive, evidence in CSP headers
billing-backend|services/billing/razorpay.ts, BillingService, controller, routes|HIGH — matches BaseService pattern|HIGH after smoke test
billing-ui|routes/pricing, routes/billing, api-client methods|HIGH — uses shadcn tokens, Razorpay Checkout script loader|HIGH
schema+migration|0007 SQL, schema.ts additions|HIGH — verified block present|MEDIUM — needs local apply + seed test
entitlements|services/entitlements/entitlements.ts|HIGH after D1Database-typed cleanup|MEDIUM — not yet called from any hot path
multi-agent-DOs|Planner/Coder/Tester/Critic + Coordinator|MEDIUM — types match, bodies are scaffolds|LOW — stubs, not wired to executeInference
agent-ui|AgentChip, PlanTree, AgentsDock, useAgentStream|HIGH — pure React, shadcn tokens|MEDIUM — not yet mounted in chat.tsx
wrangler|4 new DO bindings + v4 migration|HIGH|HIGH after `wrangler deploy`
qa-tooling|scripts/seed.ts, tests/e2e/critical-path.spec.ts, playwright.config|MEDIUM — seed password-hash format unverified|HIGH after `npm run db:seed`
docs|8 md files in docs/redesign/|n/a|n/a
```

## What's NOT In Git (Intentional — Deferred)

These are KNOWN gaps. Listing here so nobody thinks they're "done" when they're not.

## How To "Finish" From Here

Owner path — pick ONE of two endings:

### Ending A: Demo-able MVP (fastest — 1 sprint)
1. Wire `AgentsDock` + `PlanTree` into `src/routes/chat/chat.tsx` — fixture data from `seed_pro_*` session
2. Fill Razorpay test plan IDs in `wrangler.jsonc`
3. Apply migration locally + seed + run Playwright E2E → expect some to fail on password hash — fix seed
4. Deploy to Cloudflare staging
5. @PM runs QA-PROTOCOL.md Sessions 1-4
6. Ship "Public Preview" w/ multi-agent flag OFF (status quo behavior + new UI chrome + billing + seed users working)

**Result:** Pricing works, billing works, agents UI visible but still serial backend. Shippable preview that reveals the roadmap.

### Ending B: Full Multi-Agent Production (3 sprints)
1. Everything in Ending A
2. Wire sub-agent bodies to `executeInference` — each LLM prompt written + tested
3. Wire `TeamLeadCoordinator` into `CodeGeneratorAgent` behind `multiAgentEnabled` feature flag
4. Emit `agent_status` + `plan_update` on state transitions in coordinator
5. Run side-by-side benchmark (serial vs 4-parallel) on 20 real prompts — measure speedup + quality parity
6. Production Readiness Gate (all 60+ items in QA-PROTOCOL.md + main skill)
7. Ship GA

**Result:** The actual 3× speed + 43× cost wedge live.

## Risks Not Yet Mitigated

```
# schema: risk|severity|mitigation-owner
Seed password format mismatch|HIGH — blocks all Playwright login tests|@Dev
Rolldown-vite override conflict in package.json|MED — prevents fresh `npm install` locally|@Tech-Lead
File-write partitioning correctness at scale|MED — PlannerAgent tested only on toy cases|@Architect
Razorpay webhook retry behaviour (5× w/ exponential backoff)|MED — we record idempotency but don't verify retry-correctness|@QA-Lead
DO fan-out count (8 per session × N sessions) CPU-time billing|MED — no load test yet|@Architect
Critic infinite-loop prevention tested (MAX_ROUNDS=2 enforced)|LOW — code is defensive|@Tech-Lead
```

## Acceptance Statement (per SDLC Mandate)

This branch is **NOT** production-ready. It is ready for:
- ✓ Owner review of architecture direction (INFRASTRUCTURE.md + ADR-001)
- ✓ Code review by @Tech-Lead (2.5k+ lines landed, compiles assuming npm install works)
- ✓ Staging deployment of billing + UI (the non-multi-agent parts)
- ✗ Public launch
- ✗ Paid customer sign-ups (Razorpay webhook + email delivery untested in real infra)

**Recommended next owner action:** pick Ending A or Ending B, then kick off Sprint 1 with the "Must-Do Before First Paid Customer" list above.
