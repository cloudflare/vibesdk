# FARTNODE Web App

The `app/web` workspace will eventually host the Solana control panel that powers the preview experience. For now it contains:

- `lib/ids.ts` â€“ runtime program ID map written by `scripts/devnet-deploy.ts`
- Placeholder React components under `src/fartnode` (see root `src/` directory)

Future work will move the full wizard, wallet adapter, and Solana views into this directory.
